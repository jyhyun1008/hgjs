"It's our everything"

# Lyrics

我所過軌跡皆別如此

ŋaːlʔ sqʰraʔ kloːl kʷrɯwʔ ʔsleːɡ kriːl bred nja sʰeʔ

The trajectories we have walked are all so different

而所描未來且有異矣

njɯ sqʰraʔ mreːw mɯds m·rɯːɡ sʰjaːʔ ɢʷɯʔ lɯɡs ɢlɯʔ

and the futures we are depicting are also different

然而我自今向同方而

njen njɯ ŋaːlʔ ɦljids krɯm hlaŋs doːŋ paŋ njɯ

But we are facing the same side now 

以盡力唱歌奏曲

lɯʔ zlinʔ rɯɡ tʰjaŋs kaːl ʔsoːs kʰoɡ

and sing, play the song with all our strength

至於我兩臂兩脚皆微搖動之時

tjiɡs qa ŋaːlʔ raŋʔ peɡs raŋʔ kaɡ kriːl mɯl lews doːŋʔ tjɯ djɯ

until our arms and legs tremble slightly

我唱於此

ŋaːlʔ tʰjaŋs qa sʰeʔ

we will sing here

請觀之

sʰleŋʔ koːn tjɯ

Please watch us

(間奏)

人謂吾無所知

njin ɢuds ŋaː ma sqʰraʔ ʔl'e

People say I don’t know anything

而謂吾無能於每事

njɯ ɢuds ŋaː ma nɯːŋ qa mɯːʔ zrɯs

and say I am not good at everything

乃吾亦以己爲如此

nɯːʔ ŋaː laːɡ lɯʔ kɯʔ ɢʷal nja sʰeʔ

So I also thought I am that kind of person

此路甚苦而困

sʰeʔ ɡ·raːɡs ɡljumʔ kʰaːʔ njɯ kʰuːns

I’ve been sick and tired of this way

吾倒而願此生速終

ŋaː taːwʔ njɯ ŋʷans sʰeʔ sʰleːŋ sloːɡ tjuŋ

I fell down and hoped to finish this life as soon as possible

然吾不勇至於此

njen ŋaː pɯ loŋʔ tjiɡs qa sʰeʔ 

But I'm not brave enough to do so

“人性皆善”

njin sleŋs kriːl ɡjenʔ

“All people are good in nature” 

“許汝性而始於此”

hŋaʔ njaʔ sleŋs njɯ hljɯʔ qa sʰeʔ

"Accept the way you were born and start from here"

子謂此言於吾

ʔslɯʔ ɢuds sʰeʔ ŋan qa ŋaː 

Thou said this to me

然而吾初不解也

njen njɯ ŋaː sʰra pɯ kreːʔ laːlʔ

However, I could not understand this at first,

以爲無用之詞

lɯʔ ɢʷal ma loŋs tjɯ ljɯ

thought it was a useless word

子諭吾不已

ʔslɯʔ los ŋaː pɯ lɯʔ

Thou persuaded me constantly

至於吾遂悟子所言

tjiɡs qa ŋaː ljuds ŋaːs ʔslɯʔ sqʰraʔ ŋan 

until I understood what Thou said

今其命及於吾

krɯm ɡɯ mreŋs ɡrɯb qa ŋaː

now this fate has came to me

請使吾傳此意

sʰleŋʔ srɯʔ ŋaː don sʰeʔ qɯɡs

Please let me convey that message

未見之其來也

mɯds keːns tjɯ ɡɯ m·rɯːɡ laːlʔ

The future we’ve never seen

餘微苦而我無不安矣

la mɯl kʰaːʔ njɯ ŋaːlʔ ma pɯ qaːn ɢlɯʔ

little pain has left, but I don't have anything to worry about that

已作之往也 如鏡也

lɯʔ ʔsaːɡs tjɯ ɢʷaŋ laːlʔ nja kraŋs laːlʔ 

What has already been done is like a mirror

汝猶可以改是日

njaʔ klus kʰaːlʔ lɯʔ klɯːʔ djeʔ njiɡ

You can still change the day

亦次日及次其日

laːɡ sn̥ʰis njiɡ ɡrɯb sn̥ʰis ɡɯ njiɡ

also the next day and the next day of the day

若進如此

njaɡ ʔslins nja sʰeʔ

If we move forward like this,

我所望

ŋaːlʔ sqʰraʔ maŋ

what we hope for

在其中

zlɯːʔ ɡɯ tuŋ

will be inside there

若我所盡力不及於人之平時

njaɡ ŋaːlʔ sqʰraʔ zlinʔ rɯɡ pɯ ɡrɯb qa njin tjɯ beŋ djɯ

Although what we tried our best wasn't as good as what people usually do

而我所觀亦不同於人所觀

njɯ ŋaːlʔ sqʰraʔ koːn laːɡ pɯ doːŋ qa njin sqʰraʔ koːn

And though our view is different from view of others

將爲我所能而我當爲

ʔsaŋ ɢʷal ŋaːlʔ sqʰraʔ nɯːŋ njɯ ŋaːlʔ taːŋ ɢʷal

We will do what we can and what should I do,

描所望而現所夢

mreːw sqʰraʔ maŋ njɯ ɡeːns sqʰraʔ mɯŋs

depict what we hope for and visualize what we dreamed

此我之一切也

sʰeʔ ŋaːlʔ tjɯ qliɡ sn̥ʰiːd laːlʔ

It's our everything

未見之其来也

mɯds keːns tjɯ ɡɯ m·rɯːɡ laːlʔ

The future we’ve never seen

餘微懼而今我立與汝

la mɯl ɡʷas njɯ krɯm ŋaːlʔ rɯb laʔ njaʔ

little fear has left, but now we stand with you

今見之景也 極善矣

krɯm ɡeːns tjɯ kraŋʔ laːlʔ ɡɯɡ ɡjenʔ ɢlɯʔ

The sights seen now are so enjoyable

我猶可以改是日

ŋaːlʔ klus kʰaːlʔ lɯʔ klɯːʔ djeʔ njiɡ

We can still change the day

亦次日及次其日

laːɡ sn̥ʰis njiɡ ɡrɯb sn̥ʰis ɡɯ njiɡ

also the next day and the next day of the day

請進如此

sʰleŋʔ ʔslins nja sʰeʔ

Let us move forward like this

向於我未見之其来也

hlaŋs qa ŋaːlʔ mɯds keːns tjɯ ɡɯ m·rɯːɡ laːlʔ

Going toward the future we’ve never seen

餘微苦而我無不安矣

la mɯl kʰaːʔ njɯ ŋaːlʔ ma pɯ qaːn ɢlɯʔ

little pain has left, but I don't have anything to worry about that

已作之往也 如鏡也

lɯʔ ʔsaːɡs tjɯ ɢʷaŋ laːlʔ nja kraŋs laːlʔ 

What has already been done is like a mirror

汝猶可以改是日

njaʔ klus kʰaːlʔ lɯʔ klɯːʔ djeʔ njiɡ

You can still change the day

亦次日及次其日

laːɡ sn̥ʰis njiɡ ɡrɯb sn̥ʰis ɡɯ njiɡ

also the next day and the next day of the day

若進如此

njaɡ ʔslins nja sʰeʔ

If we move forward like this,

我所望

ŋaːlʔ sqʰraʔ maŋ

what we hope for

在其中

zlɯːʔ ɡɯ tuŋ

will be inside there
