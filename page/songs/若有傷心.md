And I will hug your broken heart

# Lyrics

汝吾所記 不同者也

njaʔ ŋaː sqʰraʔ kɯs pɯ doːŋ tjaːʔ laːlʔ

What's different between you and my memory

反而察之則如此多矣

panʔ njɯ sʰreːd tjɯ ʔsɯːɡ njas sʰeʔ ʔl'aːl ɢlɯʔ

When I look back, there were so many.

乃走至汝 而抱其形

nɯːʔ ʔsoːs tjiɡs njaʔ njɯ buːʔ ɡɯ ɡeːŋ

So I ran to you, and tried to hug the shape

已其形衰而不復得其本來

lɯʔ ɡɯ ɡeːŋ srul njɯ pɯ buɡs tɯːɡ ɡɯ pɯːnʔ m·rɯːɡ

But the figure had already disappeared and couldn't find the original

覺于奇夢 吾遂悟

kruːɡ ɢʷa ɡral mɯŋs ŋaː ljuds ŋaːs

I woke up from a strange dream and finally realized that

汝吾之間其有龜而裂

njaʔ ŋaː tjɯ kreːn ɡɯ ɢʷɯʔ kʷrɯ njɯ red

there might be a rift between you and me

汝其愿忘之

njaʔ ɡɯ ŋʷans maŋ tjɯ

You maybe want to forget this

故背其實而隱於至深海

kaːs pɯːɡs ɡɯ ɦliɡ njɯ qɯnʔ qa tjiɡs hljums hmlɯːʔ

So you turned back from it and hided under the deep sea

若吾身有翼如鳥

njaɡ ŋaː qʰjin ɢʷɯʔ lɯɡ njas tɯːwʔ

If I had wings like birds

吾將示汝以遠山川自此高所

ŋaː ʔsaŋ ɢljils njaʔ lɯʔ ɢʷanʔ sreːn kʰjon ɦljids sʰeʔ kaːw sqʰraʔ

I would show you the world from this highest place

若汝以爲吾有過

njaɡ njaʔ lɯʔ ɢʷal ŋaː ɢʷɯʔ kloːls

If you think I have fault

若吾能以此一曲拭汝淚

njaɡ ŋaː nɯːŋ lɯʔ sʰeʔ qliɡ kʰoɡ hljɯɡ njaʔ ruds

If I could wipe away your tears by this song

(間奏)

旣歷多年 不知之間

kɯds reːɡ ʔl'aːl niːŋ pɯ ʔl'e tjɯ kreːn

Many years have passed, and I could not realized it

汝所堪歲月唯孤獨在

njaʔ sqʰraʔ kʰluːm sqʰʷad ŋod ɢʷi kʷaː doːɡ zlɯːʔ

There's only loneliness in the years you've had

“遇難之時依吾可矣”

ŋos n̥ʰaːn tjɯ djɯ qɯl ŋaː kʰaːlʔ ɢlɯʔ

“When you're in trouble, count on me”

此言飛如風 其已無用之辭

sʰeʔ ŋan qɯl njas plum ɡɯ lɯʔ ma loŋs tjɯ ljɯ

The words sent like the wind were already useless

吾已知也 汝有許多才藝

ŋaː lɯʔ ʔl'e laːlʔ njaʔ ɢʷɯʔ hŋaʔ ʔl'aːl zlɯː ŋeds

I already know that you are versatile

然汝自以爲詛

njen njaʔ ɦljids lɯʔ ɢʷal ʔsraʔ

yet you think it is curse of yourself

吾欲示吾也以爲汝重

ŋaː loɡ ɢljils ŋaː laːlʔ lɯʔ ɢʷal njaʔ doŋs

I want to show that I see you as important

不拘何多汝才

pɯ ko ɡaːl ʔl'aːl njaʔ zlɯː

No matter how many skills you have

若吾身有翼如鳥

njaɡ ŋaː qʰjin ɢʷɯʔ lɯɡ njas tɯːwʔ

If I had wings like birds

吾將示汝以遠山川自此高所

ŋaː ʔsaŋ ɢljils njaʔ lɯʔ ɢʷanʔ sreːn kʰjon ɦljids sʰeʔ kaːw sqʰraʔ

I would show you the world from this highest place

若汝以爲吾有過

njaɡ njaʔ lɯʔ ɢʷal ŋaː ɢʷɯʔ kloːls

If you think I have fault

若吾能以此一曲拭汝淚

njaɡ ŋaː nɯːŋ lɯʔ sʰeʔ qliɡ kʰoɡ hljɯɡ njaʔ ruds

If I could wipe away your tears by this song

與汝之之其歸家路也

laʔ njaʔ tjɯ tjɯ ɡɯ klul kraː ɡ·raːɡs laːlʔ

Walking the way home with you

黑暗之布帛滿以星影

hmlɯːɡ qɯːms tjɯ paːs braːɡ moːnʔ lɯʔ sleːŋ qraŋʔ

is the dark silk fill with the starlights

相導而相從 乃及其星

slaŋ duːs njɯ slaŋ zloŋ nɯːʔ ɡrɯb ɡɯ sleːŋ

We guide each other to reach the star

若遇上帝 將告所望

njaɡ ŋos djaŋs teːɡs ʔsaŋ kuːɡs sqʰraʔ maŋ

And if I meet the Heavenly Emperor, I will tell my wish

“請使彼人 能用其才於世”

sʰleŋʔ srɯʔ pralʔ njin nɯːŋ loŋs ɡɯ zlɯː qa hljebs

“Please let them use their talent in this world”

若吾身有翼如鳥

njaɡ ŋaː qʰjin ɢʷɯʔ lɯɡ njas tɯːwʔ

If I had wings like birds

吾將示汝以遠山川自此高所

ŋaː ʔsaŋ ɢljils njaʔ lɯʔ ɢʷanʔ sreːn kʰjon ɦljids sʰeʔ kaːw sqʰraʔ

I would show you the world from this highest place

若汝以爲吾有過

njaɡ njaʔ lɯʔ ɢʷal ŋaː ɢʷɯʔ kloːls

If you think I have fault

若吾能以此一曲拭汝淚

njaɡ ŋaː nɯːŋ lɯʔ sʰeʔ qliɡ kʰoɡ hljɯɡ njaʔ ruds

If I could wipe away your tears by this song

吾將相見其目與汝

ŋaː ʔsaŋ slaŋ keːns ɡɯ muɡ laʔ njaʔ

I will face each other with you

而將抱汝之其傷心

njɯ ʔsaŋ buːʔ njaʔ tjɯ ɡɯ hljaŋ slɯm

And I will hug your broken heart
