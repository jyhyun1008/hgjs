# Lyrics

天生人之時

qʰl'iːn sreŋs njin tjɯ djɯ

When people were born,

人人之裡各有情

njin njin tjɯ rɯʔ klaːɡ ɢʷɯʔ zleŋ

they all had their own feelings

人初話之時

njin sʰra ɡroːds tjɯ djɯ

When people first speak,

人人之間皆有緣

njin njin tjɯ kreːn kriːl ɢʷɯʔ lon

they all had their tie with each other

然後時流歲過已久矣

njen ɢoːs djɯ ru sqʰʷad kloːls lɯʔ kʷlɯʔ ɢlɯʔ

And then it's been a long time 

人已忘其情而崩其緣

njin lɯʔ maŋ ɡɯ zleŋ njɯ pɯːŋ ɡɯ lon

that people have forgotten their true feelings, and they have destroyed their relationships

誰敢求其情而得其緣乎

djul klaːmʔ ɡu ɡɯ zleŋ njɯ tɯːɡ ɡɯ lon ɢaː

Who dares to seek their true feelings and acquire their relationships

唯日月星辰山川草木以景敎於我

ɢʷi njiɡ ŋod sleːŋ djɯn sreːn kʰjon sʰuːʔ moːɡ lɯʔ kraŋʔ kraːws qa ŋaːlʔ

Only the mother nyature teach to us

天生人之時

qʰl'iːn sreŋs njin tjɯ djɯ

When people were born,

人人之裡各有情

njin njin tjɯ rɯʔ klaːɡ ɢʷɯʔ zleŋ

they all had their own feelings

人初話之時

njin sʰra ɡroːds tjɯ djɯ

When people first speak,

人人之間皆有緣

njin njin tjɯ kreːn kriːl ɢʷɯʔ lon

they all had their tie with each other

作詩而誦之

ʔsaːɡ hljɯ njɯ ljoŋs tjɯ

By composing and reciting the poetry,

吾遂可見汝

ŋaː ljuds kʰaːlʔ keːns njaʔ

I will be able to meet you

造音而嘆之

sɡuːʔ qrɯm njɯ n̥ʰaːn tjɯ

By composing and sighing the notes,

汝始覺人有情

njaʔ hljɯʔ kruːɡ njin ɢʷɯʔ zleŋ

you realise that people have their feelings

而知汝吾之間有緣

njɯ ʔl'e njaʔ ŋaː tjɯ kreːn ɢʷɯʔ lon

and also know that there are some relationships between you and me

欲汝與吾相連

loɡ njaʔ laʔ ŋaː slaŋ ren

I want you to connect with me

願人與人相交

ŋʷans njin laʔ njin slaŋ kreːw

I hope people to interact with each other

自如此未成之曲

ɦljids nja sʰeʔ mɯds djeŋ tjɯ kʰoɡ
