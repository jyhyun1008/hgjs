# Lyrics

汝記乎?

njaʔ kɯs ɢaː

Do you remember?

吾生始與終也

ŋaː sreŋs hljɯʔ laʔ tjuŋ laːlʔ

During my whole life

於言行皆無所止而已

qa ŋan ɡraːŋ kriːl ma sqʰraʔ kjɯʔ njɯ lɯʔ

there were no hesitation on my words and acts

“分給汝

pɯn krub njaʔ

“I will give you

一生能用而有餘之足大勇氣”

qliɡ sreŋs nɯːŋ loŋs njɯ ɢʷɯʔ la tjɯ ʔsoɡ daːds loŋʔ kʰɯds

enough courage to spend your whole life”

當此世終

taːŋ sʰeʔ hljebs tjuŋ

When the world ends

吾遂悟之矣

ŋaː ljuds ŋaːs tjɯ ɢlɯʔ

I finally realized

吾一生所信之言

ŋaː qliɡ sreŋs sqʰraʔ hljins tjɯ ŋan

that the words I believe all my life

此不過 一介大道之一部

sʰeʔ pɯ kloːls qliɡ kreːds daːds l'uːʔ tjɯ qliɡ boːʔ

was just one part of a big principle

人世槪有許多之古事

njin hljebs kɯːds ɢʷɯʔ hŋaʔ ʔl'aːl tjɯ kaːʔ zrɯs

There are many old stories in the world

其中第一也有悔之事

ɡɯ tuŋ diːls qliɡ laːlʔ ɢʷɯʔ hmɯːʔ tjɯ zrɯs

The first of them are the regretful stories

其數次與, 而其數十次與

ɡɯ sros sn̥ʰis laʔ njɯ ɡɯ sros ɡjub sn̥ʰis laʔ

maybe for several times, or dozens of times

人悟其擇有過於事後

njin ŋaːs ɡɯ rlaːɡ ɢʷɯʔ kloːls qa zrɯs ɢoːs

people realize their choice is wrong after the things happen

吾之一生也 亦有然矣

ŋaː tjɯ qliɡ sreŋs laːlʔ laːɡ ɢʷɯʔ njen ɢlɯʔ

My whole life was also like that

吾所過也 不能以數故

ŋaː sqʰraʔ kloːls laːlʔ pɯ nɯːŋ lɯʔ sroʔ kaːs

I can't list all the things I've been wrong

其數百次與 吾視其人而終悔

ɡɯ sros praːɡ sn̥ʰis laʔ ŋaː ɡljilʔ ɡɯ njin njɯ tjuŋ hmɯːʔ

Maybe for hundreds of times, I saw the person and regretted after all

是人漸入於死之汝也

djeʔ njin zamʔ njub qa hljiʔ tjɯ njaʔ laːlʔ

the person was always you who is dying

是故爲此生無悔

djeʔ kaːs ɢʷals sʰeʔ sreŋs ma hmɯːʔ

So in order to have no regrets in this life

吾遂擇其異者

ŋaː ljuds rlaːɡ ɡɯ lɯɡs tjaːʔ

I started to choose others

爲於汝無過

ɢʷals qa njaʔ ma kloːls

Not to sin against you

吾遂知所止之重

ŋaː ljuds ʔl'e sqʰraʔ kjɯʔ tjɯ doŋs

I started to understand the importance of stopping

若吾止於此處

njaɡ ŋaː kjɯʔ qa sʰeʔ kʰljaʔ

If I stop here,

其此人非吾與 噫

ɡɯ sʰeʔ njin pɯl ŋaː laʔ qɯ

maybe the person must not be me Ah

此無用之人乎?

sʰeʔ ma loŋs tjɯ njin ɢaː

Are they useless person?

抑知世之人乎?

qɯɡ ʔl'e hljebs tjɯ njin ɢaː

or are they the person who understand the world?

當此時

taːŋ sʰeʔ djɯ

At that time

世末終來於吾

hljebs maːd tjuŋ m·rɯːɡ qa ŋaː

the end of the world finally came to me

吾與汝兩人皆有無言

ŋaː laʔ njaʔ raŋʔ njin kriːl ɢʷɯʔ ma ŋan

We did not say anything

黑暗之形狀始盖此萬物

hmlɯːɡ qɯːms tjɯ ɡeːŋ zraŋs hljɯʔ kaːbs sʰeʔ mlans mɯd

The darkness began to cover everything

莫論雖善惡

maːɡ ruːns sqʰʷi ɡjenʔ qaːɡs

regardless of if they are good or bad

當此世終

taːŋ sʰeʔ hljebs tjuŋ

When the world ends

吾亦悔之矣

ŋaː laːɡ hmɯːʔ tjɯ ɢlɯʔ

I regretted it again

數次所復見之事

sros sn̥ʰis sqʰraʔ buɡs keːns tjɯ zrɯs

The event that I've seen many times

其終也 必擇次惡而可矣

ɡɯ tjuŋ laːlʔ pliɡ rlaːɡ sn̥ʰis qaːɡs njɯ kʰaːlʔ ɢlɯʔ

At result, it was enough if I picked the lesser evil

(間奏)

與惡之一體感抑吾

laʔ qaːɡ tjɯ qliɡ r̥ʰiːʔ kɯːmʔ qɯɡ ŋaː

My sense of unity with evil oppresses me

故吾始顫手足

kaːs ŋaː hljɯʔ tjans hnjɯwʔ ʔsoɡ

So my hands and legs are trembling

與苦之一體感抑吾

laʔ kʰaːʔ tjɯ qliɡ r̥ʰiːʔ kɯːmʔ qɯɡ ŋaː

My sense of unity with pain oppresses me

故「汝」之悲

kaːs njaʔ tjɯ prɯl

Sadness about you who have passed away

吾使萬事歸而爲原

ŋaː srɯʔ mlans zrɯs klul njɯ ɢʷal ŋʷan

I tried to put everything back to the origin

然旣消之汝不歸 噫

njen kɯds sew tjɯ njaʔ pɯ klul qɯ

But you who disappeared do not return Ah-

以此爲末 吾走至於當汝猶生時

lɯʔ sʰeʔ ɢʷal maːd ŋaː ʔsoːs tjiɡs qa taːŋ njaʔ klus sreŋs djɯ

Take this as the last time, I will run to the time when you were still alive

是故爲此生無悔

djeʔ kaːs ɢʷals sʰeʔ sreŋs ma hmɯːʔ

So in order to have no regrets in this life

是故爲於汝無過

djeʔ kaːs ɢʷals qa njaʔ ma kloːls

So not to sin against you

是故吾將戰與人世之至固之勢

djeʔ kaːs ŋaː ʔsaŋ ʔsaŋ laʔ njin hljebs tjɯ tjiɡs kaːs tjɯ hŋjeds

So I will fight the very old-fashioned force of the world

自今

ɦljids krɯm

Right now

汝記乎?

njaʔ kɯs ɢaː

Do you remember?

吾終回歸此也

ŋaː tjuŋ ɡuːl klul sʰeʔ laːlʔ

I finally came back here

於言行皆無所止而已

qa ŋan ɡraːŋ kriːl ma sqʰraʔ kjɯʔ njɯ lɯʔ

There is no hesitation on my words and acts

“分給汝

pɯn krub njaʔ

“I will give you

一生能用而有餘之足大勇氣”

qliɡ sreŋs nɯːŋ loŋs njɯ ɢʷɯʔ la tjɯ ʔsoɡ daːds loŋʔ kʰɯds

enough courage to spend your whole life”

當此世終

taːŋ sʰeʔ hljebs tjuŋ

When the world ends

吾遂悟之矣

ŋaː ljuds ŋaːs tjɯ ɢlɯʔ

I finally realized

吾一生所信之言

ŋaː qliɡ sreŋs sqʰraʔ hljins tjɯ ŋan

that the words I believe all my life

其終也 一個大道之一切

ɡɯ tjuŋ laːlʔ qliɡ kaːls daːds l'uːʔ tjɯ qliɡ sn̥ʰiːd

was just everything of a big principle

當此時

taːŋ sʰeʔ djɯ

At that time

世末終來於吾

hljebs maːd tjuŋ m·rɯːɡ qa ŋaː

the end of the world finally came to me

吾與汝兩人皆有無言

ŋaː laʔ njaʔ raŋʔ njin kriːl ɢʷɯʔ ma ŋan

We did not say anything

黑暗之形狀始盖此萬物

hmlɯːɡ qɯːms tjɯ ɡeːŋ zraŋs hljɯʔ kaːbs sʰeʔ mlans mɯd

The darkness began to cover everything

莫論雖善惡

maːɡ ruːns sqʰʷi ɡjenʔ qaːɡs

regardless of if they are good or bad

當此世終

taːŋ sʰeʔ hljebs tjuŋ

When the world ends

吾亦悟之矣

ŋaː laːɡ ŋaːs tjɯ ɢlɯʔ

I realized it again

末次所復見之事

maːd sn̥ʰis sqʰraʔ buɡs keːns tjɯ zrɯs

The event that I see for the last time

雖其如次惡而其實最善

sqʰʷi ɡɯ njas sn̥ʰis qaːɡ njɯ ɡɯ ɦliɡ zloːds ɡjenʔ

Even if it looks like the lesser evil, it's actually the best
